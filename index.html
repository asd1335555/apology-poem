		<h1>Forgiveness from Laiza-chan</h1>
		<hr>
		<h2>by Chintu Nungshiba</h2>

		<h3>An Excerpt from Chapter Y</h3>

		<p><span>O</span>n the serene morning of January 29th, 2024, as the sun painted the sky with hues of soft pastels, Chintu's heart skipped a beat as the melodious sound of Laiza's call echoed through the air. However, in a twist of fate, Chintu, immersed in the dreams of their shared future, missed the call. The princess, Laiza, feeling a gentle sting of annoyance, became the protagonist in the story of their love. In an earnest quest for redemption, Chintu, fueled by the passion that only true love could inspire, crafted a novel tale woven with words, each one a plea for forgiveness and a promise of eternal devotion.</p>

		<p>In hills so high where echoes play,<br>
            A sunset paints the end of day.<br>
            Amidst the clouds in skies so bright,<br>
            I missed your call, my heart takes flight.<br><br>
            
            The morning sun, a golden kiss,<br>
            I slumbered deep in dreams of bliss.<br>
            Beneath the stars, in midnight's trance,<br>
            I seek forgiveness for love's chance.<br><br>
            
            Through rolling hills and starry night,<br>
            I yearn to make our moments right.<br>
            Apologies whispered in the breeze,<br>
            To mend the hurt, put hearts at ease.<br><br>
            
            Forgive my sleep that held me tight,<br>
            As skies aglow with soft moonlight.<br>
            In every cloud and sunset hue,<br>
            My love for you, forever true.<br><br>
            
            So in these words, my heart unveils,<br>
            A simple poem of hills and trails.<br>
            For you, my dear, under moonlit lights,<br>
            I apologize for missed delights.</p>

        <p><span>A</span>s the final verse of Chintu's poetic plea gently settled into the night, he closed the pages of his heart, hoping Laiza would read between the lines. In the realm of reality, with sincerity in his eyes, he turned to Laiza and softly uttered, "Will you forgive my laziness, Laiza?" The moonlit scene held its breath, awaiting the response that would determine the next chapter of their love story.</p>
